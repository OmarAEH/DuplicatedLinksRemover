# Duplicated Links Remover
Use this script to remove duplicate links from a large links file, this script is a part from one of my private scraping bots that I can't share here, but this script can work as independent script.

# Requirements:
1. Python 3.x.

# How to use this ?
1. Make sure you have Python installed.
2. You need 2 txt files. one named "Links.txt" and the other "Results.txt".
3. Add your links to Links.txt file, make sure to add every link at a single line.
4. Run the script and it will filter and remove all the duplicate links.
5. After the run is complete check the Results.txt file you will find the final result there.
